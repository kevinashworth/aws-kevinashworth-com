1 smallish pumpkin: Cut in half, clean guts, microwave the halves upside down until the pumpkin is nice and soft. (5-7 minutes)

Meanwhile, saute progressively:

* Some oil
* Half a small onion, finely diced
* Some chili pepper (I used a big pinch of flakes, fresh Serrano would be nicer.)
* 1/2 tsp tumeric
* 1/2 tsp coriander
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp curry powder
* Some freshly ground ginger (1 Tbsp?)
* Minced garlic (2-3 cloves)
* 1/2 C finely shredded unsweetened coconut
* Some black pepper

Add cooked pumpkin, smash it up a bit. Add

* about 2 C water
* 1/2 C raisins

Simmer covered at least an hour. Salt to taste.

P.S. I also added 2-3 Tbsp of honey near the end.

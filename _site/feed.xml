                &lt;h3 id=&quot;renée-zellweger-in-judy&quot;&gt;Renée Zellweger in &lt;em&gt;Judy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full-body transformation! Look at her spine, neck, shoulders, voice, face, and a core character attitude. These are all different from Renee’s default way of being. What a remarkable transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brad-pitt-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood--laura-dern-in-a-marriage-story&quot;&gt;Brad Pitt in &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; Laura Dern in &lt;em&gt;A Marriage Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see full-body transformations here. These are performances that are strong throughout, and that hinge on the characters’ core attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cast-of-knives-out&quot;&gt;The Cast of &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rian Johnson on the actors: “Getting the caliber of actors we were able to get, you know, I think they were able to take the characters much bigger than they maybe even read on the page. And because &lt;strong&gt;it takes a really good actor to give, like, a huge performance&lt;/strong&gt; like that and still have it not tip over into it feeling just like a joke, to have it still feel like it has its feet on the ground, or at least one foot on the ground at all times. And so, &lt;strong&gt;I think the cast that we got allowed us to play it a little broader than it maybe even read on the page and still have the movie tick.&lt;/strong&gt;” (From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wga.org/3rdandfairfax/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;3rd &amp;amp; Fairfax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast episode 179, starting at the 34:44 mark. Emphasis mine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to be big and good requires being a better actor than to be medium and good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(P.S. Also watch Rian talk about the big, good performances in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/u67hupQgIaI?t=597&quot;&gt;this SAG-AFTRA Foundation Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cast-of-parasite&quot;&gt;The Cast of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought they were a great ensemble. Voted for them for the SAG Awards. Juicy acting throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;go-get-em&quot;&gt;Go Get ’Em!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be bold, fellow actors. Be big and juicy. Train well and be “huge” if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Sharing once again &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019-bookmarklets-for-the-sag-aftra-health-plan-site/&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; bookmarklets for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.sagaftraplans.org/health/&quot;&gt;SAG-AFTRA Health Plan Benefits Manager&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void%20function()%7Bvar%20e=new%20Date,t=e.getDate(),a=e.getMonth()+1,n=e.getFullYear();10&amp;gt;t%26%26(t=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;+t),10&amp;gt;a%26%26(a=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;+a),e=a+&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;+t+&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;+n,$(&amp;quot;input&amp;quot;)%5B6%5D.value=&amp;quot;01/01/2020&amp;quot;,$(&amp;quot;input&amp;quot;)%5B7%5D.value=e;$(&amp;quot;%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn&amp;quot;).click();%7D();&quot;&gt;Health 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I go the Earnings page, I tend to want to see my YTD earnings. This bookmarklet populates the date fields for January 1, 2020, to today&#39;s date, and activates the Find button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void%20function()%7B$(%22input%22)%5B6%5D.value=%2201/01/2019%22,$(%22input%22)%5B7%5D.value=%2212/31/2019%22;$(%22%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn%22).click();%7D();&quot;&gt;Health 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I also often want to see last year&#39;s earnings. This bookmarklet populates the date fields for 2019 and activates the Find button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void%20function()%7B$(%22input%22)%5B6%5D.value=%2201/01/2018%22,$(%22input%22)%5B7%5D.value=%2212/31/2018%22;$(%22%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn%22).click();%7D();&quot;&gt;Health 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Same for the year before last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:$(%27#earningsList_rppDD%20option[value=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;]%27).prop(%27selected%27,true);$(%27#earningsList_rppDD%20option[value=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;]%27).change();setTimeout(function(){$(%27table[role=&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;]%20thead%20tr%27).append(%27&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Row&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;%27);$(%27table[role=&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;]%20tfoot%20tr%27).append(%27&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Row&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;%27);$(%27table[role=&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;]%20tr.ui-widget-content%27).each(function(i,val){var%20row=%27&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%27+(i+1).toString()+%27&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;%27;$(this).append(row);});},1000);&quot;&gt;Health Rows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This bookmarklet adds a column with the row number at the end of the table. I find this super helpful! But this functionality breaks once you change any other settings, so just refresh the plan&#39;s website if anything gets wonky. In fact, if the site doesn’t work quite right after clicking any of these bookmarklets, just refresh the whole site and start over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Safari or Chrome on a desktop computer, install these underlined bookmarklets by dragging the links to your bookmarks bar — but only after you are logged in to the new site and are looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.sagaftraplans.org/health/benefit/earnings.jsf&quot;&gt;Earnings History page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I came across this tweet today. It’s pretty funny and it gave me a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Pe3kHlEXxs&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Pe3kHlEXxs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; laurie records (@laurierecords) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurierecords/status/1152275249217409024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 19, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But it also inspired me to respond to it in a serious fashion with this post about the teaching of acting, especially as I read the comments about another acting teacher and Botox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, your face and its various parts are arguably the most important part of your instrument. And if you present bad acting there, if you are locked into a certain line reading and a certain gesture and they don’t work, you are probably doomed. And if you want to do Botox for your true self, or as your choice for it to be part of your look and not your technique, and not as a part of trying to please an acting teacher, do it. And further, for many actors if you are young enough, beautiful enough, ripped enough, connected enough, lucky enough, et cetera, et cetera, all that stands between you and some sweet acting gigs may well be an &lt;em&gt;absence of bad acting&lt;/em&gt;. And I’d say that’s where I started, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most actors, for the sake of audiences everywhere, and in the name of mastery and excellence, I think that the kind of teaching that focuses on the absence of bad acting is wholly incompatible with the approach I would advocate for instead: the &lt;em&gt;presence of good acting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I was first introduced to this concept by my friend, the uber-talented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2436248/&quot;&gt;Ellen Adair&lt;/a&gt;. She said something to me like, if your one line is “Do you want fries with that?”, there’s not a lot you can do with it and perhaps the key to booking that part is Don’t Be Bad. She then went on to speak on behalf of Being Good as a much better thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to get to my point about &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Pe3kHlEXxs&quot;&gt;the tweet&lt;/a&gt;, and at the risk of extrapolating too much from a couple of sentences out of context, this get-rid-of-it kind of “teaching” is a &lt;strong&gt;major red flag&lt;/strong&gt; and you should run away from this “teacher” as fast as you can! (If you could see my face right now, you’d know I really mean it because of what I’m doing with my eyebrows, not by what I’m not doing with them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s the short version. We could talk for years about this, including a deep dive into “You are enough” and pleasing others, but I’ll end it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the good acting teachers out there who help actors use their entire instrument, onward in your pursuit of excellence! Three cheers to the abundant presence of good acting!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting wherein I got a good look at how notes that you or your representation submit on Actors Access / Breakdown Services are seen by the folks in casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of what casting sees, copied from actual notes. I should add that notes appear in a standard sans-serif font to the folks in casting, but I include them here using a fixed-width font to illustrate a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1234567890123456789012345678901234567890...

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line is something I included to show that the cutoff is clearly 40 characters. On the last line, the submitter included an errant space after “Adv,” and you should know that the penultimate note showed “years” as “y/ears”, looking something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Actually retired

ears in...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, what casting directors see, if they don’t click through to read the whole note, is the first 40 characters, and after about the 32nd character, words may wrap in an ugly way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you submit better notes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a fantastic shoot as a Guest Star on &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc.go.com/shows/for-the-people&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I got to play a judge for the first time, and it was awesome. Though I mostly just sat there, it was a long shoot day with take after take of exploring, and doing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and having fun, and even hamming it up a little (a lot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It first aired on May 2, 2019. The clip here is an edited version that includes lots of coverage of other actors, to tell the story arc for Vondie Curtis-Hall&#39;s SDNY judge character in this episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody on the set of &lt;strong&gt;FTP&lt;/strong&gt; was a pleasure to work with. Thank you for the very fun times! Thank you exec, director and writer Tom Verica, Valerie Weiss and Chelsea Grate, series reg Vondie, and fellow cast mates Brea, Jill, Matt, Courtney, Devika, Sandy, Tracy, Brendan, Zach, and B-cam and C-cam Andy and Alicia, and wardrobe Ambre, and makeup Kati, and hair Staci, and PA Andrea, and tall AD Terry, and everybody else on that set! And thank you of course to casting director Jamie Castro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void%20function()%7Bvar%20e=new%20Date,t=e.getDate(),a=e.getMonth()+1,n=e.getFullYear();10&amp;gt;t%26%26(t=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;+t),10&amp;gt;a%26%26(a=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;+a),e=a+&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;+t+&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;+n,$(&amp;quot;input&amp;quot;)%5B6%5D.value=&amp;quot;01/01/2019&amp;quot;,$(&amp;quot;input&amp;quot;)%5B7%5D.value=e;$(&amp;quot;%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn&amp;quot;).click();%7D();&quot;&gt;Health 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I go the Earnings page, I tend to want to see my YTD earnings. This bookmarklet populates the date fields for January 1 to today, and activates the Find button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void%20function()%7B$(%22input%22)%5B6%5D.value=%2201/01/2018%22,$(%22input%22)%5B7%5D.value=%2212/31/2018%22;$(%22%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn%22).click();%7D();&quot;&gt;Health 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Out of morbid curiosity or for legitimate tax purposes, I often want to see last year&#39;s earnings. This bookmarklet populates the date fields for 2018 and activates the Find button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void%20function()%7B$(%22input%22)%5B6%5D.value=%2201/01/2018%22,$(%22input%22)%5B7%5D.value=%2212/31/2018%22;$(%22%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn%22).click();%7D();&quot;&gt;Health 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Same for the year before last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:$(%27#earningsList_rppDD%20option[value=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;]%27).prop(%27selected%27,true);$(%27#earningsList_rppDD%20option[value=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot;]%27).change();setTimeout(function(){$(%27table[role=&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;]%20thead%20tr%27).append(%27&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Row&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;%27);$(%27table[role=&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;]%20tfoot%20tr%27).append(%27&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Row&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;%27);$(%27table[role=&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;]%20tr.ui-widget-content%27).each(function(i,val){var%20row=%27&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%27+(i+1).toString()+%27&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;%27;$(this).append(row);});},1000);&quot;&gt;Health Rows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This bookmarklet adds a column with the row number at the end of the table. This functionality breaks once you change any other settings, so just refresh the web page if it gets wonky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Safari on a desktop computer, simply install these underlined bookmarklets by dragging the links to your bookmarks bar, then clicking on them — but only after you are logged in to the new site and are looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.sagaftraplans.org/health/benefit/earnings.jsf&quot;&gt;Earnings History page&lt;/a&gt;. For other browsers, you’ll probably need to manually install them by creating a new bookmark and pasting in the raw Javascript code that you access by right-clicking the bookmarklet and copying its code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If things don’t work quite right after clicking a bookmarklet, just refresh the whole page and start over. I’ve used them many times. Let me know how they work for you!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/noun_Airplane_88_000000.png&quot; alt=&quot;noun_Airplane_88_000000 Public Domain&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; width=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;To my peers: why wouldn’t you offer more to your actors when you can?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re producing a web series on a dime, great. But if it goes somewhere, gets turned into a movie or a successful pitch to a network, why not offer in writing some guarantee to your actors up front about that. Something more than what SAG-AFTRA requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re producing theater on a dime, great. But what happens if you keep raising ticket prices, it extends, sells out. Why not offer the actors more than the small stipend you put in the breakdown for your code production. Not something AEA requires, but something you promise upfront if it’s a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re producing under a SAG-AFTRA agreement that allows you to defer pay, what if through some extra-successful pre-production you find some extra funding – why not pay the actors more than the zero dollars SAG-AFTRA stipulates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a playwright and you’re getting paid (even though I know it’s likely to be peanuts for a ton of time you spent creating this play), and if you’re covered by the Dramatists Guild or some such, but the actors who made your play an unexpected success, with royalties to you from Sam French sales beyond what you had imagined … well, those actors are not covered by a good contract, so why not offer, voluntarily as the enlightened artist that you are and not at the behest of AEA, why not offer subsidiary rights? Why not offer to share your profits with the actors who helped you create those profits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re shooting under SAG-AFTRA’s ULB agreement, and paying your actors a mere $125/day, but hey it goes great and you get distribution, why not bump your cast an extra chunk of change? SAG-AFTRA doesn’t require it, but why not put that in writing. It costs you nothing unless your film goes somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is me saying I’d like to see more producers and actor-producers move from “we have no money, end of sentence” to “we have no money now, but our aim is high and here is a lovely contractual obligation I am voluntarily promising you if this happens to be one of those projects that go somewhere, and yes indeed it is in writing and it’s not some sort of vague oral statement about how I’ll reciprocate somewhere down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go full Melania and tell you to #BeBest, but why not #BeALittleBetter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;
P.S. And it’s not just about a few more dollars. The worst 3 auditions I’ve had in this town (not for my performance, which was extraordinary, but for the people on the other side of the so-called table) were for a film made by actors and theater made by actors. And while the scheduling from low-budget projects is often very wonderfully flexible, when it’s bad, it’s way worse than fully financed projects.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;
P.P.S. I also want to make it clear that all of this is completely different from the problem of well-funded non-union commercials and non-union national tours. We should all be doing everything we can to fight that, to shut that down. What I’m talking about is a tweak of what seems to be a growing amount of low-budget stuff, but it&#39;s stuff that doesn’t need to be shut down, just improved.
&lt;/div&gt;

Zeus was a total douche, for instance. We all know that we should really just call him Zouche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That guy in the Old Testament who was into ripping open pregnant women on a genocidal level, well, let’s just say “Yikes!” about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bad god that simply has to go is MAGA Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAGA Jesus has zero interest in getting those loaves and fishes to his hungry followers. MAGA Jesus is not gonna turn his other cheek, no sirree. MAGA Jesus does not give parables about who your neighbor is, because MAGA Jesus knows that you know that that is determined by skin color, duh. MAGA Jesus throws the first stone right into the forehead of women caught in adultery. Well, I may have gone too far on that one; MAGA Jesus is way more into slut-shaming. MAGA Jesus thinks peacemakers are cucks. Or maybe they’re snowflakes, I’m not really sure about that one either, but at any rate, I think you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I propose the following chant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey hey, ho ho, MAGA Jesus has to go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun. Sing it with me! Maybe together we can Make Jesus Great Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;javascript:void%20function()%7Bvar%20e=new%20Date,t=e.getDate(),a=e.getMonth()+1,n=e.getFullYear();10&gt;t%26%26(t=&quot;0&quot;+t),10&gt;a%26%26(a=&quot;0&quot;+a),e=a+&quot;/&quot;+t+&quot;/&quot;+n,$(&quot;input&quot;)%5B6%5D.value=&quot;01/01/2018&quot;,$(&quot;input&quot;)%5B7%5D.value=e;$(&quot;%23earningsForm%5C%5C:findBtn&quot;).click();%7D();&#39;&gt;Health 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I go the Earnings page, I tend to want to see my earnings from January 1, 2018 to today. This bookmarklet populates the date fields and presses the Find button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;javascript:$(%27#earningsList_rppDD%20option[value=&quot;100&quot;]%27).prop(%27selected%27,true);$(%27#earningsList_rppDD%20option[value=&quot;100&quot;]%27).change();setTimeout(function(){$(%27table[role=&quot;grid&quot;]%20thead%20tr%27).append(%27&lt;th&gt;Row&lt;/th&gt;%27);$(%27table[role=&quot;grid&quot;]%20tfoot%20tr%27).append(%27&lt;td&gt;Row&lt;/td&gt;%27);$(%27table[role=&quot;grid&quot;]%20tr.ui-widget-content%27).each(function(i,val){var%20row=%27&lt;td&gt;%27+(i+1).toString()+%27&lt;/td&gt;%27;$(this).append(row);});},1000);&#39;&gt;Health Rows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Add a column with the row number at the end of the table. Probably breaks once you change any other settings, so just refresh from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try them out by dragging the links to your bookmarks bar, then clicking on them &amp;mdash; but only after you are logged in to the new site and are looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.sagaftraplans.org/health/benefit/earnings.jsf&quot;&gt;Earnings page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things don&#39;t work quite right after clicking a bookmarklet, just refresh the whole page and start over. I&#39;ve tested these on Safari, Firefox and an iPhone. Let me know how they work for you!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;To delete all those pesky .DS_Store files and see what they were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find . -name .DS_Store -type f -delete -print&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To list all the globally installed node packages, but cleanly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm list -g --depth=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To delete all local branches that are already merged into the currently checked out branch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git branch --merged | egrep -v &quot;(^\*|master|dev)&quot; | xargs git branch -d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the clip embedded above, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/CDMcQmGM3UA&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Top of Show Guest Star of &lt;strong&gt;NCIS&lt;/strong&gt; episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7553366/&quot;&gt;High Tide&lt;/a&gt;, I got to play an arrogant rich man who owns multiple yachts. It was a great chance to be somebody that I am not. (Although I do love me some yacht rock!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrogance of this character Richard Lane in contrast to the humility of the Spencer Publications employee &lt;a href=&quot;/acting/bold/&quot;&gt;I played on &lt;strong&gt;The Bold &amp;amp; the Beautiful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the things that tickles me about acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me add that the cast and crew of &lt;strong&gt;NCIS&lt;/strong&gt; are legendary in this town for being kind and welcoming, and my experience with them was the same. A big thank-you for the many good days on set to series regulars Mark, Sean, Wilmer, Emily and Duane, and director and writers Tony, Stephen and David, and fellow guest stars Marshall and Ramiz, and DP Bill Webb, and everybody else on that set! And thank you especially to casting directors Susan Bluestein and Jason Kennedy, who kept bringing me in. Again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A trove of acting books came my way recently, and from it I plucked out and read the following plays:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOYER by Gardner McKay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MARRIAGE-GO-ROUND by Leslie Stevens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAD HABITS by Terrence McNally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE COUNTRY GIRL by Clifford Odets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAUGHING WILD by Christopher Durang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAREFOOT IN THE PARK by Neil Simon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Durang I must recommend most highly of these. Makes me think how far behind culturally I was. He was writing that stuff in the ’80s, when his insights were so insightful that I would have not been willing to read his play or see it. Made me think, laugh, cry. What else could you want from a script?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m glad I read them all, none struck me as something that should be staged right now. (This is something I’m hoping to stumble upon, by the by, as I read a bunch of plays this fall.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the trove were some books I passed on: CAREER by James Lee, MARRIAGE CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH by Arnold Kane, and 2 Minutes And Under, and a second copy of BAD HABITS. They’re yours if you want them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the clip embedded above, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/238203622&quot;&gt;on Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shoot was a great experience for me. Not that most shoots aren’t great experiences. But the material of this scene was meaningful to me  – I get choked up about health and insurance issues so often these days – and the audition process, and the subsequent shoot came at just a right time. Scott and Darren were great to work with, and I loved being there. I hope “Employee” comes back and gets a name. I’d dig that. Ed Scott, write me back in, buddy!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I have in my possession a DVD of short Harvard student films. I appear in two of them. The students were all shooting from the same skeletal script, and if you watch the shorts, you’ll see very different films, but, at the end of the day, a bunch of typical student films. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EXCEPT&lt;/span&gt;. Except there’s one shot that stands out: a crazy swerving zoom in to the moment when the poison I’ve administered does her in. The setup for that shot kept us up quite late that night, like 4am. Maybe later. It was a lot of work for that one shot. But Damien had a vision, and he made it happen, like no other director on that DVD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching the opening scene of &lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt;, I immediately saw a connection with the elaborate camera work, and I laughed. Sure, I laughed in delight for the music and dance and love and all that goodness, as I’m sure many audience members have also laughed in sheer delight. But I laughed, too, to see the connection to the film we shot at Harvard, and the fact that he’s still doing it, with the zooms and the setups that are off the charts, be it for the meager resources at hand, or off the charts for the history of film. A lot of work went into that crazy awesome freeway shot, and boy does Damien’s vision pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Chazelle, I look forward to what you’re going to do next!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;del&gt;Christmas&lt;/del&gt; &lt;ins&gt;Nightmare&lt;/ins&gt; Song&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nuts roasting on an open fire;&lt;br /&gt;
Mike Pence clipping off your toe;&lt;br /&gt;
Your bride Carol being tongued by Paul Ryan:&lt;br /&gt;
Not jokes messed up like news that&#39;s faux,&lt;br /&gt;
Everybody knows that Trumpey with our missile codes&lt;br /&gt;
Helps to make these nightmares bright.&lt;br /&gt;
Whiny snots with red ties worn too low&lt;br /&gt;
Make it hard to sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They care that Santa isn&#39;t gay.&lt;br /&gt;
They focus all their justices on Roe v Wade.&lt;br /&gt;
But every decent child and FBI&lt;br /&gt;
Wanna see if Putin really knew how to spy.&lt;br /&gt;
And so I&#39;m offering this simple phrase&lt;br /&gt;
To swing states that should now be blue.&lt;br /&gt;
Although it&#39;s been tweeted many times, many ways,&lt;br /&gt;
On this Christmas, screw you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to kill the working class.&lt;br /&gt;
These loaded good ol&#39; boys will get us in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;
And every right-wing pile is gonna try&lt;br /&gt;
To give the sincere reason to cry.&lt;br /&gt;
And so I&#39;m offering this sinful phrase&lt;br /&gt;
To ids who&#39;ve-voted-straight-Republican since &#39;Ninety-Two.&lt;br /&gt;
Although it&#39;s been Facebooked many times, many ways,&lt;br /&gt;
On this Christmas, (middle finger) you.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A little verse because the things that rhyme are so. very. disturbing. (I&amp;#8217;ve written &lt;a href=&quot;/politics/verse/&quot;&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; that are more humorous, as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herr Drumpf does not &lt;i&gt;see guile&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
As those who do find &lt;i&gt;fault might&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Having never seen such &lt;i&gt;swine furor&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
I wonder how can he &lt;i&gt;not see&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Orange-elect eats wheatgrass whole&lt;br /&gt;
(Not as a juice), from a glass bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
If we give him a chance,&lt;br /&gt;
And don’t move to France,&lt;br /&gt;
We can all say buh-bye to our greenhouse gas goal.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Orange-elect needs a date, time&lt;br /&gt;
And place to begin his &amp;ldquo;terrific&amp;rdquo; great climb&lt;br /&gt;
To the top of a hill&lt;br /&gt;
To trumpet a bill&lt;br /&gt;
That will henceforth decree the number eight prime.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Orange-elect isn&amp;rsquo;t wussy.&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;s rich and his life is quite cushy.&lt;br /&gt;
But to our surprise&lt;br /&gt;
He gets energized&lt;br /&gt;
By playing Claire de Lune by Debussy.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Orange-elect needs a bassist.&lt;br /&gt;
His studio&amp;rsquo;s decked out with the latest.&lt;br /&gt;
With this new companion&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;ll get rid of Bannon&lt;br /&gt;
And they&amp;rsquo;ll form a duet just to play Liszt.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;: These links no longer work. You need to call Zipcar now to set up your account at a lower rate for union members.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Zipcar from time to time. For my fellow professional actors, here&#39;s a quick tip: You qualify for a discount!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use these links:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zipcar.com/actorsequity&quot;&gt;zipcar.com/actorsequity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Sharing some bookmarklets for the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.sagaftraplans.org/health/&quot;&gt;SAG-AFTRA Health Plan Benefits Manager&lt;/a&gt; site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;javascript:void%20function(){var%20e=new%20Date,t=e.getDate(),a=e.getMonth()+1,n=e.getFullYear();10%3Et%26%26(t=%220%22+t),10%3Ea%26%26(a=%220%22+a),e=a+%22/%22+t+%22/%22+n,$(%22input%22)[6].value=%2201/01/2016%22,$(%22input%22)[7].value=e;$(&quot;#earningsForm\\:findBtn&quot;).click();}();&#39;&gt;Health 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I go the Earnings page, I tend to want to see my earnings from January 1, 2016 to today. This bookmarklet populates the date fields and presses the Find button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;javascript:$(%22.ui-row-toggler%20span%22).click();$(%22.ui-datatable-even%22).switchClass(%22ui-datatable-even%22,%20%22ui-datatable-odd%22);&#39;&gt;Health All More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each row of the Earnings page has a &quot;More&quot; link at the end. This bookmarklet opens all of them at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Try them out by dragging the links to your bookmarks bar, then clicking on them &amp;mdash; but only after you are logged in to the new site and are looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.sagaftraplans.org/health/benefit/earnings.jsf&quot;&gt;Earnings page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things don&#39;t work quite right after clicking a bookmarklet, just refresh the whole page and start over. I&#39;ve tested these on Safari, Firefox and an iPhone. Let me know how they work for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I respect the view of any actors or stage managers who are fully informed of their rights and choices and wish to [donate] their talent to the stage &amp;hellip; but it does not follow that the freedom to volunteer should infringe on the rights of the most vulnerable among us, who are legally entitled to be paid for their work. &amp;hellip; For those at the margins of our community, a little help can make a big difference in their quality of life. It may enable them to continue in the field that we all cherish so deeply. It&amp;rsquo;s that crucial oil change you neglected so you can keep driving to rehearsals. It&amp;rsquo;s taking a day off from a stressful day-job. It&amp;rsquo;s their money, they earned it, and if they ask for it, it&amp;rsquo;s the law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The play and its author, Young Jean Lee, have generated a lot of talk, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-new-american-playwrights-20151122-column.html&quot;&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-straight-white-men-review-20151124-column.html&quot;&gt;least&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-young-jean-lee-20151122-story.html&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; recent articles in the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;. Information about this production, including tickets and driving directions, can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centertheatregroup.org/tickets/kirk-douglas-theatre/2015-16/straight-white-men/&quot;&gt;Center Theatre Group’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Short message because I have a lot of other things to do right now (!), but I will be tweeting updates with the hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23swmigo&quot;&gt;#swmigo&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., &lt;strong&gt;Straight White Men — I’m going on&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: all-small-caps;&quot;&gt;Wednesday update&lt;/span&gt;: It was a blast last night, but I don’t expect to go on again. Will post more updates if that changes!)&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I asked a simple question, and I got a simple answer. &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal/video/VDKA0_uqv8w95b&quot;&gt;Watch on abc.go.com&lt;/a&gt; — spoiler alert, it’s entitled, “Olivia Pope Admits to Being the President’s Mistress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was well suited for the new 50-Seat Showcase Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was well suited for the new 99-Seat Agreement, or maybe even SPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would fit well into the new Self-Produced Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was produced by a membership company, who will continue to produce under the Membership Company Rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were more than one that are the sort of thing that should be non-union theater. Those were my first L.A. experiences, and my worst experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in thinking back, I come up with an interesting cross-section of the L.A. small-theater scene. One takeaway: I&#39;m glad they won&#39;t all be lumped together under one Plan anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

But gave them another gift, which has many of the same pros and cons. In fact only one of my bullet points needs to be edited, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEA Council gave us all another gift, as well&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;a broader palette of codes and agreements to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I&#39;m wondering which theater will be the first to use SPT now that it&amp;rsquo;s available here in Los Angeles? Which theater will be the first to use the new 99-Seat Agreement? Who will be the first to use the LA Self-Produced Project Code or the new LA 50-Seat Showcase Code? (Hollywood Fringe Festival, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever is the first to use these, I hope they&amp;nbsp;post it far and wide. I want to buy a ticket to the first&amp;nbsp;show produced under each of these 4 codes. I want&amp;nbsp;to inaugurate these new opportunities, and to celebrate them with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language of the LOS ANGELES SELF-PRODUCED PROJECT CODE is identical to what was in the initial proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of the LOS ANGELES MEMBERSHIP COMPANY RULE changed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of the LOS ANGELES 99-SEAT THEATRE AGREEMENT is very close to the version that was in the initial proposal. The one change in the version that Council passed today is that it specifies 2-hour blocks instead of 3-hour blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/noun_74172_cc.png&quot; alt=&quot;gift box by Norbert Kucsera from the Noun Project&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; width=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;If you are an existing membership company in Los Angeles, this is an amazing opportunity. How could AEA give you a bigger gift than this? Accept it – and flourish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can continue doing business as usual with your current membership – and with actors who are members of other membership companies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those ranks are swelling like never before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The energy, determination and focus in your company have never been higher&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have been guaranteed an advantage over some of the more prominent current competitors, and all future competitors. Let me repeat, you have been guaranteed an advantage over all future competitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Donors have heard the news, and many are now more likely to donate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is too much supply in your marketplace, and this real change will probably bring about a market correction, allowing you to stand out – and reap the financial reward for standing out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many existing limits, obligations and restrictions just went bye-bye&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The potential profitability of a hit just went way up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next few years will be – by far – the best opportunity membership companies have ever been given to work, thrive and flourish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one recipe to survive is simple. If you simply sock away the tens of thousands of dollars that you have just been given, and use it as necessary, and not begrudgingly, on new contracts that will be required from time to time, your future is ensured well beyond the next few years. I really do believe that is the accurate way to look at it: you have just been given tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And on top of all this, you will have the satisfaction of employing actors, and you will have been part of real change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you don’t like the new world and its amazing gifts, you just have to disband for 12 short months and then get together again as a loose affiliation of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if the “Plan A” and “Plan B” ideas that I mention above don’t work for you, find another way. You’re correct in observing that you won’t be able to operate in your current manner in perpetuity, but remember that you are creative and resourceful individuals who will find another way, and you’ll turn this opportunity into a business plan where you can pay the required wage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This large, amazing, unique gift has been laid at your feet. Welcome it. Practice acceptance.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Accept this change (the sooner the better), and get to work. The very critical Phase One is happening right now, and it goes until April 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what? There’s another little gift, even if we don’t like talking about this one. You see, if you do screw it up, or if you do your very best and you still don’t survive for reasons beyond your control, you have a scapegoat. Everyone will agree you were great, and that it was all Equity’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A GIFT – SEIZE IT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I have yet to see anybody talk about the positive financial impact of all of the proposed changes. Consider these back-of-the-envelope calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;First, I can only make financial estimates if I make a few assumptions:&lt;br /&gt;
You play within the Equity rules now, you will continue to play by the Equity rules, and you don’t give actors anything that you are not required to.&lt;br /&gt;
You sell tickets for $34, but via GoldStar, so really just $17.&lt;br /&gt;
You have 50 seats in your theater.&lt;br /&gt;
You put on 4 shows per year.&lt;br /&gt;
You rehearse for 36 hours per week over 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
You run each show for 24 performances. One show a year does really well, and you add another 12 performances.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;These are my assumptions, some more important to the math than others. Second, consider some of the changes in the new, upcoming LA Membership Company Rule about tickets:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ticket prices&lt;/strong&gt;. Old rule: $34.99 max. New rule: no maximum price.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Complimentary tickets&lt;/strong&gt;. Old rule: approx 9 comps per member. New rule: no comps required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;AEA members at the door&lt;/strong&gt;. Old rule: half price. New rule: no discount required.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Let’s estimate that these ticket-related changes will combine to allow you to get $3 more per seat, even if only for one of your shows. Maybe you ask for $40 and give them away at half price. Or maybe you say goodbye to Goldstar, because by golly your show is now worth $20 period. Either way, with $3 more per seat on one of your shows, you just increased revenue by $3,600.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Also, you ask $50 for a gala opening night. Your donors and fan base like you, so you sell out and you just increased your revenue by $1,600.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Your show is a real hit, you add another 12 performances. At $3 a seat, that’s another $1,800 in increased revenue compared to the current rules.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Combined, that adds up to $7,000 of increased revenue, for your one hit show. Of course, these estimates will be reduced if you can’t sell the tickets, but I’m assuming at least one of your shows is good and successful as I make these rough estimates. I mean, I’ve seen the enthusiastic full houses when something rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;By the way, this $7,000 of increased revenue goes into a pot. You save it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Now consider that the Equity proposal changes other rules, which are not directly related to tickets. These will surely add value to your bottom line, as well. Soon you’ll be allowed 10-out-of-12 techs, soon you can run forever, soon you’ll have no requirements about future rights, soon it will be okay to ask members to pay dues, etc. etc. Let’s say all these things impact your bottom line by $1,000 per show, regardless of its success. This is a wild-ass guess, but you’ve always insisted these things have been real constraints in the current world, so I can only conclude that they must have some real financial value. Arbitrarily, I say a grand. It might be a helluva lot higher. If you don’t play within the current rules, it could be much lower. I’m open to hearing other numbers. Whatever number it is, it goes into a pot.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s add it up. You put on 4 shows a year, but only 1 is very successful and able to take advantage of all this new revenue. So all 4 shows will improve by $1,000 and 1 will improve by $7,000 above that. That’s $11,000 more revenue per year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, you won’t be adding company members after April 1, 2015, which is a real change, but that won’t really have a direct impact on your shows for about 3 years. That is, for 3 years, you’ll choose material differently, more precisely suited to your 2015 membership. Most casts now seem to be exclusively made up of your company, so it seems a good assumption that you’ll cast strictly within the membership for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Fast forward past the next 12 shows, when you realize you need a supporting cast member that cannot be found within your company. By now, you’ve had 3 shows that did really well, and 9 that were not able to take advantage of new ticket revenue, and as we saw above you now have a pool of reserves of $33,000. At that time, you will utilize the 99-seat Agreement for the first time, and you will pay this supporting cast member a salary based on minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It’s a supporting role so she is in half of the rehearsals, and she is hired for the best-case scenario of one of your hits, therefore you’ll pay this Actor $486 for rehearsal and $702 for those 36 blockbuster performances. And this $1,188 salary will come from your pool of increased revenue you’ve set aside for just such an occasion. Recall, that pool will be $33,000 (plus interest) at this point. Except wait! She’s really great, your show is really great, and that pool goes to approximately $39,000 with this show, even accounting for her new salary.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Now, you may be worried that because she is so good, you might go dark one night when she’s shooting a TV or film role. But that can and does happen now with your current members, so we can only deduct $150 ($3 higher ticket price of a full house) from your bottom line if this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;So, it seems that you could add 2 contracts per show for all of your shows going forward for quite some time to come, and this pool of reserves will be there to pay for all those contracts. Further, this all assumes that you simply keep your same business model and you only have one successful show per year. There are ways that you can change your business model and further improve your bottom line. Your company is run by creative and resourceful individuals who will find a way to thrive after Council adopts these proposed changes on April 21, 2015. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Council approved this unanimously, the vote is advisory only. Do the math. This gift is coming. Those who practice opposition at this point are spending energy for naught. Welcome it. Acceptance is the key. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Let dreamers dream&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; what worlds they please&lt;br /&gt;
Those Edens can&amp;rsquo;t be found&lt;br /&gt;
The sweetest flowers&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; the fairest trees&lt;br /&gt;
Are grown in solid ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re neither pure&lt;br /&gt;

We&amp;rsquo;ll do the best we know&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll build our house&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; and chop our wood&lt;br /&gt;
And make our garden grow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found this &lt;em&gt;Candide&lt;/em&gt; lyric over the years to be very moving. Just watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlVD-jrq_Yk&quot;&gt;this version&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. It gave me goosebumps. So lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The year 2015 has gotten off to a good start with multiple shoots in January. I have worked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agent-carter&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Agent Carter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and more than one episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scandal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oh the spoilers I could tell you! But I won’t tell. I was truly moved reading the scripts, and these lovely stories will have to unfold before your very eyes soon enough on &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/&quot;&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, I’ll tweet about them … soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;1. Be open-minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Strive to understand what is most likely to be true, not to believe what you wish to be true.&lt;br /&gt;
3. The scientific method is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Every person has the right to control of their body.&lt;br /&gt;
5. God is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and recognize that you must take responsibility for them.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Treat others as you would want them to treat you, and can reasonably expect them to want to be treated. Think about their perspective.&lt;br /&gt;
8. We have the responsibility to consider others, including future generations.&lt;br /&gt;
9. There is no one right way to live.&lt;br /&gt;
10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, not knowing their provenance, would disagree with any of these? (This is a serious question, not rhetorical.)&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This is a delicious substitute for mashed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 large cauliflower, cut into pieces&lt;br /&gt;
1/4 cup butter or 1/4 cup homemade yoghurt&lt;br /&gt;
salt, pepper to taste&lt;br /&gt;
parsley and paprika garnish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook cauliflower until just tender.&lt;br /&gt;
Drain.&lt;br /&gt;
Pur&amp;eacute;e in blender or food processor.&lt;br /&gt;
Add butter or yoghurt, salt and pepper, and blend thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;
Reheat and serve.&lt;br /&gt;
Garnish with parsley and paprika.&lt;br /&gt;
The pur&amp;eacute;ed cauliflower may be placed in a baking dish, sprinkled with grated cheddar cheese and heated in the oven until the cheese melts.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Recent bookings this fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shot another episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4167128/fullcredits&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scandal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oh the spoilers I could tell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4079620/fullcredits&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane the Virgin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a cheap lawyer. Fun scene!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4037850/fullcredits&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faking It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a pageant announcer. Purple bow-tie awesomeness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filmed an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4124016/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marry Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a, let’s just say, well-meaning pediatrician.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one might actually be the most hilarious. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbc.com/marry-me&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marry Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very funny so far in its first episodes, and that shoot was definitely the zaniest. We wrapped in the wee hours of the morning and it was cuh-razy! I’ll post more here and/or on Twitter for all of them as their air dates approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned tonight that &lt;em&gt;Breath and Imagination&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://lastagealliance.com/ovation-awards-nominees-announced/&quot;&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; for the 2014 Ovation Awards in the category of &lt;em&gt;Best Play (Large Theatre)&lt;/em&gt;. And Karan has an individual nomination, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the award ceremony on Sunday, November 2, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Actors: If you&amp;rsquo;re new to pursuing commercials in Los Angeles, you can turn to many paid online and print sources to learn who casts commercials in L.A. and where they work. The thing is, these lists aren&amp;rsquo;t visual, and they contain long lists, while the reality is that the few, busiest commercial casting directors do most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/r1iic&quot;&gt;this map&lt;/a&gt; I made over on the Google. It shows the busiest commercial casting locations in LA. This is handy information! (But not complete information. Some good commercials do get cast elsewhere, but most commercial actors are going to one of these places whenever they get an audition from their agent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good luck!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;My show at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colonytheatre.org/upcomingshows.html&quot;&gt;Colony Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in Burbank, &lt;em&gt;Breath and Imagination&lt;/em&gt;, proved to be very special, with an electric response from our audiences, unlike anything else I’ve ever been a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;What the Tea Party believes in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideological purity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compromise as weakness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denying science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unmoved by facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undeterred by new information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hostile fear of progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A demonization of education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A need to control women&amp;rsquo;s bodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe xenophobia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tribal mentality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intolerance of dissent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathological hatred of the US government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pzqq9sxKkY&quot;&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;, for this true list of bad things.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;They like us. They really like us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Ashworth and Leslie Stevens transmute these thankless, cliché-ridden roles into gold through their characters’ no-nonsense acceptance of their faults. Like Kinsolving, Ashworth handles a compelling monologue by balancing emotionalism with cold objectivity.&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backstage.com/review/la-theater/-chapter-two-neil-simon-laguna-playhouse/&quot;&gt;Backstage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GO. As her best friend and his younger brother, Leslie Stevens and Kevin Ashworth skillfully provide the broad characters Simon’s audiences had expected up to this point.&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2013/01/dostoevskys_notes_from_underground.php&quot;&gt;LA Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As comic relief, Ashworth manages to carry off both loving, supportive brother and serial philanderer.&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stagescenela.com/2013/01/chapter-two/&quot;&gt;StageSceneLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Ashworth sported a funky, thick mustache and often stole the show with his high-energy performance and crazy antics about life.&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://stunewslaguna.com/index.php/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=7506:chapter-two-011513&quot;&gt;Stu News Laguna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terrific cast. A rousing revival by a splendid company at the Laguna Playhouse.&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailypilot.com/entertainment/tn-dpt-0118-titus-mother-hat-chapter-two-20130116,0,3189152.story&quot;&gt;Daily Pilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to lighten the serious tones, Simon creates flawed buddies for the protagonists, and the play couldn’t do better than Kevin Ashworth’s Leo and Leslie Stevens’ Faye. Ashworth’s playboy Leo looks like a 1970’s version of a young Jack Nicholson with his polyester clothing and his thin mustache.&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lasplash.com/publish/Los_Angeles_Performances_116/chapter-two-theatre-review-a-theatrical-best-seller-at-laguna-beach.php&quot;&gt;LA Splash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

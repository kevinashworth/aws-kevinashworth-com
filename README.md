I build [my website](http://kevinashworth.com/) with this code. It uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) (both offer MIT Licenses), and I deploy it on AWS S3 using [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website). All my original content is copyrighted â€” but mostly I only care about anything that rhymes.

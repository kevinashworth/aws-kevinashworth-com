I build [my website](http://kevinashworth.com/) with this code. It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) (both offer MIT Licenses), and I deploy it on S3. All my original content is copyrighted â€” but mostly I only care about anything that rhymes.

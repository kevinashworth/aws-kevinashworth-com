<p>Let dreamers dream<br />
&nbsp; what worlds they please<br />
Those Edens can&rsquo;t be found<br />
The sweetest flowers<br />
&nbsp; the fairest trees<br />
Are grown in solid ground</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re neither pure<br />
&nbsp; nor wise nor good<br />
We&rsquo;ll do the best we know<br />
We&rsquo;ll build our house<br />
&nbsp; and chop our wood<br />
And make our garden grow</p>
<p>I've found this <em>Candide</em> lyric over the years to be very moving. Just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlVD-jrq_Yk">this version</a> on YouTube. It gave me goosebumps. So lovely.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="/assets/images/noun_236742_cc.png" alt="noun_236742_cc" width="150" height="150" />I've been involved in a handful of 99-seat productions, and I almost got involved in a few others.</p>
<p>One was well suited for the new 50-Seat Showcase Code.</p>
<p>One was well suited for the new 99-Seat Agreement, or maybe even SPT.</p>
<p>One would fit well into the new Self-Produced Code.</p>
<p>One was produced by a membership company, who will continue to produce under the Membership Company Rule.</p>
<p>And then there were more than one that are the sort of thing that should be non-union theater. Those were my first L.A. experiences, and my worst experiences.</p>
<p>So in thinking back, I come up with an interesting cross-section of the L.A. small-theater scene. One takeaway: I'm glad they won't all be lumped together under one Plan anymore!</p>

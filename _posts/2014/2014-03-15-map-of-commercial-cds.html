<p>Actors: If you&rsquo;re new to pursuing commercials in Los Angeles, you can turn to many paid online and print sources to learn who casts commercials in L.A. and where they work. The thing is, these lists aren&rsquo;t visual, and they contain long lists, while the reality is that the few, busiest commercial casting directors do most of the work.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/r1iic">this map</a> I made over on the Google. It shows the busiest commercial casting locations in LA. This is handy information! (But not complete information. Some good commercials do get cast elsewhere, but most commercial actors are going to one of these places whenever they get an audition from their agent.)</p>
<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>

"Call me Ishmael."

And may I call you Ishmael, too, fellow performer. We are all together on this ride. But I am very concerned. We face a number of Captain Ahabs. I count them at 7 — and growing — and in a little over 48 hours, we shall see the result. 

If you recall, the monomaniacal Ahab destroyed the _Pequod_, and Ishmael was the lone survivor. Given the growing number of Ahabs, I hope we have more than one Ishmael, too.

Just had a fantastic shoot as a Guest Star on [**For the People**](https://abc.go.com/shows/for-the-people). I got to play a judge for the first time, and it was awesome. Though I just say there, it was a long shoot day with take after take of exploring, and doing[^1], and having fun, and even hamming it up a little. (Okay, a lot.)

Everybody on the set of **For the People** was a pleasure to work with. Thank you for the very fun times, series reg Vondie, and exec, director and writer Tom, Valerie and Chelsea, and fellow cast mates Brea, Jill, Matt, Courtney, Devika, Sandy, Tracy, Brendan, Zach, and B-cam and C-cam Andy and Alicia, and wardrobe Ambre, and makeup Kati, and hair Staci, and PA Andrea, and tall AD Terry, and everybody else on that set! And thank you of course to casting director Jamie Castro.

It will probably air on April 25 or May 2, 2019. Pics & video then!
